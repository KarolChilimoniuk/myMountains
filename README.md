### How to launch the page?
***
1. First of all, you should install node.js on your computer software (of course, if you haven't done it earlier). Next step is download a file (In order to do it, visit [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/)) and installation. To being sure node is installed, run your software terminal and write command:
```sh
   node -v
```
   (if node is installed you will see number of current installed version).
2. Run computer terminal as administrator and install Gulp Task Runner by using:

```sh
npm install -g gulp-cli
```
3. Clone repository to your new project file.
4. Third step is initialization of NPM to your project by using:
```sh
npm init
```
and installation of the NPM components(packages) by using command:
```sh
npm install
```
5. If you have done every above steps, you can run the project in live preview. In order to this you have to use command: 
```sh
gulp
```
in your terminal. 
If you want to close live preview - use ***ctrl + c***.
